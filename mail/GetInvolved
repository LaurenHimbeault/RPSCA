Get Involved
With your help, we can make River Park South an even greater place to live!
The River Park South Community Association (RPSCA) is looking for new committee members and volunteers to support our efforts and enhance our association with new skills and connections. Let us know if you're interested in lending a hand with planning, fundraising, volunteering at events or other activities. We will highlight more opportunities for involvement as we continue to build the RPSCA.
How to get involved:
•	Attend the RPSCA committee meetings (details on Events page) to meet your neighbours, share your ideas, and hear what's happening in the association and the community
•	Join a sub-committee (more information to come)
•	Sign up to be a volunteer at our events 
•	Sign up for our upcoming e-newsletter 
•	Contact us directly
